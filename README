# Gameplay #
############

This is in essence just a demo of what is to come, the main
racing features such as lap timing, lap counting, and AI
racers are far from complete, so just enjoy the eye candy.

The default keys are:

Forward:	W
Backward:	S
Left:		A
Right:		D
Air Brake:	Space
Fullscreen:	F1

These keys can be changed by editing the config file, which
is fairly self explanatory.

Have fun
